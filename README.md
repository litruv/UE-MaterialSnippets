# UEMatLib

UEMatLib is a library of materials for use in Unreal Engine. Each material comes with a preview, snippet, and description to help you choose the right one for your project.

- `author`: The author of the material.
- `name`: The name of the material.
- `categories`: A list of categories the material belongs to.
- `preview`: A path to the preview image of the material.
- `snippet`: A path to the snippet file of the material.
- `description`: A brief description of the material.

## Usage

To use a material, simply copy the snippet from the `snippets` folder and paste it into your Unreal Engine project.
